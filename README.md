# Summer Chores
---
## Description
Demonstrate knowledge of asynchronous JavaScript techniques including callbacks, promises, and async/await.
The program simulates a series of summer chores by waiting a certain amount of time before each chore is complete.
A random number is generated with each attempted chore to determine if it is completed or not.

## Instructions/Usage
Live Server can be used to open the program, and a version of the doSummerChores function using callbacks, promises or async/awit can be chosen by clicking one of the available buttons. The output will be logged to the console (note the suffixes indicating which method is being used. _cb means callback, _p means promise, and _aa means async/await).
